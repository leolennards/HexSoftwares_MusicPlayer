# 🎶 Web Music Player

## 📌 Project Overview

This is a simple **Web Music Player** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It allows users to play, pause, skip, and control volume while showing a playlist of songs.  
The design is minimal and modern, inspired by clean music apps.

This project was created as part of my **Hex Softwares Internship – Web Development Task 2**.
